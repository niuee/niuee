- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @niuee

I am a mechanical engineering graduate who happens to take interest in coding in general.<br>
My learning path begun when I started taking courses within the CS curriculum in college. <br>

I have most of my projects in college here on github.<br>
Feel free to check those out. However, I haven't touch many of them since college. <br> 
I intend to revisit those during my free time at work.<br>

#### Below is the list of those project
- [Web crawler](https://github.com/niuee/simple-crawler) implemented in C++ with a custom parser for urls and site content. 
A [Search engine](https://github.com/niuee/simple-searchengine) using three different data structures: BST, Array, and HashTable(from CS 251 in purdue)
- [IRC server](https://github.com/niuee/ircserver-practice) for real time chatting with features like chat room and user account (from CS 240 in purdue)

#### Current Side Projects
After I left my previous job I started to keep myself busy by catching up with the backend development in the web dev industry. 
I have started a series of side projects that will ultimately come together as a horse racing simulation game. 
I have applied some of the stuff that I learned about backend tech in some of the projects. Everything with a hr(horse racing) prefix is part of the project. 
- [HR Racetrack Maker](https://github.com/niuee/hrracetrack-maker)
- [HR Physics Engine](https://github.com/niuee/hrphysics-simulation)
- [HR GraphQL](https://github.com/niuee/hrGraphql)
- [HR Crawler](https://github.com/niuee/hrcrawler)

Some other projects that are worth checking out
- [Web Component Library](https://github.com/niuee/vnt-component-library)
- [point2point](https://github.com/niuee/point2point)
