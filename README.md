- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @niuee

I come from a mechanical engineering background and am interested in coding in general.<br>
My learning path began when I started taking courses within the CS curriculum in college. <br>

I have most of my projects in college here on GitHub.<br>
Feel free to check those out. However, I haven't touched many of them since college. <br> 
I intend to revisit those during my free time at work.<br>

#### Below is the list of those project
- [Web crawler](https://github.com/niuee/simple-crawler) implemented in C++ with a custom parser for urls and site content. 
A [Search engine](https://github.com/niuee/simple-searchengine) using three different data structures: BST, Array, and HashTable(from CS 251 in Purdue)
- [IRC server](https://github.com/niuee/ircserver-practice) for real-time chatting with features like a chat room and user account (from CS 240 in Purdue)

#### Current Side Projects
- [board](https://github.com/niuee/board) This library transforms a regular canvas element into a pannable, zoomable, and rotatable near-infinite canvas. 
- [board Testground](https://github.com/niuee/vCanvas-testground) This is the sandbox where I test out the capabilities of the board element in [board](https://github.com/niuee/vCanvas)
- [bounce](https://github.com/niuee/bounce) This is the animation backbone I plan to use in my new portfolio website showcasing the board element.
- [bolt](https://github.com/niuee/bolt) This is a simplified physics simulation engine originated from the [python](https://github.com/niuee/hrphysics-simulation) version. The implementations are almost identical. However, to optimize the collision detection a bit, I added a quadtree for the broad phase.
- [bend](https://github.com/niuee/bend) This is a simple, bezier curve-related computation library.
- [point2point](https://github.com/niuee/point2point) This is a 2D vector-related library I use in my other projects. For instance, the [bend](https://github.com/niuee/bend) and the [board](https://github.com/niuee/board).

#### Still finding time to develop these.
After I left my previous job, I started to keep myself busy by catching up with the backend development in the web dev industry. 
I have started a series of side projects that will ultimately come together as a horse racing simulation game. 
I have applied some of the stuff I learned about backend tech in some projects. Everything with a hr(horse racing) prefix is part of the project. 
- [HR Racetrack Maker](https://github.com/niuee/hrracetrack-maker)
- [HR Physics Engine](https://github.com/niuee/hrphysics-simulation)
- [HR GraphQL](https://github.com/niuee/hrGraphql)
- [HR Crawler](https://github.com/niuee/hrcrawler)
