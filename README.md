- 👋 Hi,

I started a HTML canvas application development toolkit, [@ue-too](https://github.com/ue-too/ue-too). It has many util packages that can jump start a canvas based web application.

#### ue-too is organized into modular packages:

- [**`@ue-too/being`**](https://github.com/ue-too/ue-too/tree/main/packages/being) - Finite state machine <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ue-too/being.svg" alt="npm version" style="vertical-align: middle">
- [**`@ue-too/board`**](https://github.com/ue-too/ue-too/tree/main/packages/board) - Canvas viewport management with pan, zoom, and rotate functionality <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ue-too/board.svg" alt="npm version" style="vertical-align: middle">
- [**`@ue-too/math`**](https://github.com/ue-too/ue-too/tree/main/packages/math)) - Mathematical utilities for 2D point operations, transformations, and calculations <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ue-too/math.svg" alt="npm version" style="vertical-align: middle">
- [**`@ue-too/animate`**](https://github.com/ue-too/ue-too/tree/main/packages/animate) - Animation system for smooth transitions and keyframe animations <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ue-too/animate.svg" alt="npm version" style="vertical-align: middle">
- [**`@ue-too/dynamics`**](https://github.com/ue-too/ue-too/tree/main/packages/dynamics) - 2D physics engine with collision detection, rigid bodies, and constraints <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ue-too/dynamics.svg" alt="npm version" style="vertical-align: middle">
- [**`@ue-too/curve`**](https://github.com/ue-too/ue-too/tree/main/packages/curve) - Curve and path tools including Bézier curves, lines, and composite paths <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ue-too/curve.svg" alt="npm version" style="vertical-align: middle">
- **`@ue-too/border`** - Geographic projection utilities (great circle, rhumb line, map projections) <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ue-too/border.svg" alt="npm version" style="vertical-align: middle">
- **`@ue-too/ecs`** - Entity Component System architecture support <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ue-too/ecs.svg" alt="npm version" style="vertical-align: middle">



#### Still finding time to develop these.
After I left my previous job, I started to keep myself busy by catching up with the backend development in the web dev industry. 
I have started a series of side projects that will ultimately come together as a horse racing simulation game. 
I have applied some of the stuff I learned about backend tech in some projects. Everything with a hr(horse racing) prefix is part of the project. 
- [HR Racetrack Maker](https://github.com/niuee/hrracetrack-maker)
- [HR Physics Engine](https://github.com/niuee/hrphysics-simulation)
- [HR GraphQL](https://github.com/niuee/hrGraphql)
- [HR Crawler](https://github.com/niuee/hrcrawler)
