- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @niuee

I am fascinated with the concept "Infinite Canvas", so I started a library, "board", that covers the ground work of creating a web app that uses infinite canvas.

#### Current Side Projects
- [board](https://github.com/niuee/board) This library transforms a regular canvas element into a pannable, zoomable, and rotatable near-infinite canvas. 
- [board Testground](https://github.com/niuee/vCanvas-testground) This is the sandbox where I test out the capabilities of the board element in [board](https://github.com/niuee/board)
- [bounce](https://github.com/niuee/bounce) This is the animation backbone I plan to use in my new portfolio website showcasing the board element.
- [bolt](https://github.com/niuee/bolt) This is a simplified physics simulation engine originated from the [python](https://github.com/niuee/hrphysics-simulation) version. The implementations are almost identical. However, to optimize the collision detection a bit, I added a quadtree for the broad phase.
- [bend](https://github.com/niuee/bend) This is a simple, bezier curve-related computation library.
- [point2point](https://github.com/niuee/point2point) This is a 2D vector-related library I use in my other projects. For instance, the [bend](https://github.com/niuee/bend) and the [board](https://github.com/niuee/board).

#### Still finding time to develop these.
After I left my previous job, I started to keep myself busy by catching up with the backend development in the web dev industry. 
I have started a series of side projects that will ultimately come together as a horse racing simulation game. 
I have applied some of the stuff I learned about backend tech in some projects. Everything with a hr(horse racing) prefix is part of the project.

- [HR Physics Engine](https://github.com/niuee/hrphysics-simulation)
- [HR GraphQL](https://github.com/niuee/hrGraphql)
- [HR Crawler](https://github.com/niuee/hrcrawler)
