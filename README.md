- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @niuee

I am a mechanical engineering graduate who happens to take interest in coding in general.<br>
My learning path starts in college where I started taking courses within the CS curriculum. <br>

I have most of my projects in college here on github.<br>
Feel free to check those out. I haven't touch many of them since college. <br> 
I intended to revisit those during my free time at work.<br>

#### Below is the list of those project
- [Web crawler](https://github.com/niuee/simple-crawler2) implemented in Java with a multithreaded search system. (from CS 180 in purdue)
- [Web crawler](https://github.com/niuee/simple-crawler) implemented in C++ with a custom parser for urls and site content. 
A [Search engine](https://github.com/niuee/simple-searchengine) using three different data structures: BST, Array, and HashTable(from CS 251 in purdue)
- [IRC server](https://github.com/niuee/ircserver-practice) for real time chating with features like room and user account (from CS 240 in purdue)

#### Current Plan
Right now I am in a drone company developing extension features for current drones using ROS(Robot Operating System).
I am learning techs that are used in web-dev especially in back-end.
