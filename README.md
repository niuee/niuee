- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @niuee

I am a mechanical engineering graduate who happens to take interest in coding in general.<br>
My learning path begun when I started taking courses within the CS curriculum in college. <br>

I have most of my projects in college here on github.<br>
Feel free to check those out. However, I haven't touch many of them since college. <br> 
I intend to revisit those during my free time at work.<br>

#### Below is the list of those project
- [Web crawler](https://github.com/niuee/simple-crawler) implemented in C++ with a custom parser for urls and site content. 
A [Search engine](https://github.com/niuee/simple-searchengine) using three different data structures: BST, Array, and HashTable(from CS 251 in purdue)
- [IRC server](https://github.com/niuee/ircserver-practice) for real time chatting with features like chat room and user account (from CS 240 in purdue)

#### Current Plan
I worked on developing new features for autonomous vehicle (mostly agricultural drones) at my previous job. I am currently seeking new opportunity in web-dev and backend particularly. 
I have been studying a lot of concepts, design practices, and techonologies used in the web-dev backend field (I understand I still have a lot to learn tho). I am working on a horse racing simulation game that is sort of like a mock of the Japanese video games like "Winning Post" and/or "Derby Stallion". I planned to apply some of the stuff that I learned in backend along the way (so this would be mostly a web-based game) and hopefully would have a demo before I land my next job (fingers crossed; on the job hunt I mean). Everything you see that has the "hr" prefix (horse racing; lame I know; I am still working on the name) are all related to the horse racing simulation side project.
